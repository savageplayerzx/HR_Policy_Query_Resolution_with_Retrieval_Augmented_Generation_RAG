## Description

This repository is a hub for an innovative HR Policy Query Resolution system utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. Our system leverages a 4-bit quantized Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) along with JP Morgan Chase’s publicly available Code of Conduct documents to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses for HR policy queries. With the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, we aim to revolutionize the way HR policies are understood and accessed within organizations.
